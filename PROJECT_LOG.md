# Counterfoil Frontend — Project Log

> **Living document.** Update this at the end of every meaningful unit of work (every commit
> that changes structure, adds a phase, makes a decision, or resolves an open question).
> If you are a new Claude Code session, or an engineer joining the project, **read this top
> to bottom before doing anything else.** It is the single source of truth for _what exists,
> what was decided, and what is still open._

## 1. What this is

Frontend for **Counterfoil** — an operator-owned SaaS platform for venues, tours, and
attractions (timed entry, tickets, bookings). Built by **Ternary Solutions**; ~20 operators
run the current version across Bangladesh, Malaysia, the US and Canada.

This repo is a **single Next.js app with two surfaces**:

| Surface | Who | Device | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OS** | Operator admin | Desktop | Configuration, management, reporting. Dense. |
| **Go** | Front-of-house staff | Tablet (browser) | Point of sale, scanning, shifts. Touch. |

**The backend does not exist yet.** Every screen runs off a typed **mock data layer** with a
single swap point (`src/lib/api/client.ts`, built in Phase 3) so the backend team can replace
mock calls with real API calls by editing one file.

**The bar:** basic but structurally sound — an internal demo, not a launch. Cut visual polish,
transitions, empty-state art, microcopy. **Do not** cut component structure, data-fetching
patterns, form-state handling, or routing structure. ~15 CRUD screens are coming; the whole
point is to build the table/form/primitives **once** and reuse them.

## 3. Stack (as actually built)

- **Next.js 16.2.12**, App Router — ⚠️ brief specified 15; see **Decision D1**
- **React 19.2.4**
- **TypeScript**, `src/` dir, `@/*` import alias
- **Tailwind v4** (`@theme` syntax — no v3 config file) ✅ confirmed in `package.json`
- **npm**
- **lucide-react** — sanctioned icon library ✅ installed; use at 1.5px stroke / 24 grid
  (brand icon spec). Primitive layer lives in `src/components/ui/*` (import from `@/components/ui`).
- **Fonts:** Manrope + DM Mono via `next/font/google` (Phase 2)
- Deployed on **Vercel**

> ⚠️ This is **Next 16**, which has breaking changes vs the Next you may know. See the
> generated `AGENTS.md` — read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing app code.

## 4. Phase tracker

Work proceeds in checkpoints. **Stop at every checkpoint. Do not chain phases.**

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Environment check | ✅ Done |
| **1** | Scaffold · repo · first deploy | ✅ Done |
| **2** | Design tokens (`/tokens` route) | ✅ Done |
| **3** | Routing structure + typed data layer (`src/lib/api`, `src/lib/mock`) | ✅ Done |
| **4** | Primitive component layer (`/kitchen-sink` route) | ✅ Done |
| **5** | Products — the reference CRUD screen | ✅ Done |
| **6** | Scaffold sweep — every remaining Stream 1 screen | ⬜ In progress |
| **later** | OS: Locations · Counters · Staff · Business Setup · Booking Rules · Pricing · Orders · Dashboard · Sales Reports · Calendar | ⬜ |
| **later** | Go: PIN login/shift open · POS · Cash payment · Ticket issued · Scan · Scan result · Shift close | ⬜ |

Full phase-by-phase brief lives in `counterfoil_claude_code_prompts.md` (kept **local only**,
not committed — see D3). Two Go screens need extra care: the **POS till** (tap efficiency) and
the **scan result** (readable in <1s at 3m; colour alone is not enough — shape + text must carry).

## 5. Decisions log

- **D1 — Next.js 16 over 15** (2026-07-29): `create-next-app@latest` resolved to **16.2.12**;
  owner chose to keep it rather than pin to 15. Trade-off accepted: breaking changes vs 15 and
  possibly-stale model knowledge of Next conventions.
- **D2 — default branch `main`** (2026-07-29): renamed from create-next-app's `master`.
- **D3 — roadmap doc kept out of git** (2026-07-29): `counterfoil_claude_code_prompts.md`
  (internal build prompts) is **not committed** — this is a public repo.
- **D4 — public repo** (2026-07-29): per owner. Created + pushed via `gh repo create` using a
  classic PAT with `repo` scope (the fine-grained PAT first supplied could not create repos).
- **D5 — type contract locked** (2026-07-29): reviewed the draft entity types and locked the
  final shapes (`src/lib/api/types.ts`). Decisions: one `status: Lifecycle` across entities;
  `ApiResult<T>` (no silent throws); offset pagination; `Counter.isOpen` moved off to a future
  Shift entity; `Permission` stays `string[]` until the Roles screen; single `Operator.currency`
  (BDT). Added `Operator` and `Category` (were referenced but undefined); multi-interval
  `OpeningHours`; `ProductImage[]` objects; `Staff` gains `invited/suspended` + email-or-phone.
- **D6 — no BT badge in the UI** (2026-07-29): per owner. `Product.bookingType` stays as a data
  field (backend needs it) but is never rendered. This makes the BT-02/04/07 numbering conflict
  a pure backend concern — off the UI's plate. `BookingTypeMeta` dropped.
- **D7 — guardrail** (2026-07-29): a `PreToolUse` hook in `~/.claude/settings.local.json` hard-
  denies any command touching the other Ternary repos (ternary-website-v3 / -local-dump /
  -prod-dump / -design-mockups) or running a destructive `gh repo` op. The owner now maintains
  this guardrail themselves; do not modify it.
- **D8 — semantic colours added** (2026-07-29): the brand palette has no functional status
  colours, so `--color-success/-warning/-danger/-info` were added to `@theme`. These are NOT
  brand accents (used only for status pills, destructive actions, inline feedback), so the
  "one accent per screen" rule still refers to ember alone.
- **D9 — autonomous build** (2026-07-29): owner asked to stop pausing at checkpoints and build
  the full scope to best judgment, deploying at each checkpoint. Only pause when genuinely
  blocked on a decision only they can make.

## 6. Open questions / to settle

- **~~BT numbering conflict~~** — RESOLVED for the UI (D6): the BT badge is not rendered, so the
  brand-vs-Jira disagreement (BT-04/07 swapped, BT-02 contested) no longer affects the frontend.
  Still a backend concern whenever booking-type behaviour is implemented, but not blocking here.
- **Derived colour scales are unconfirmed** (Phase 2): only the 3 brand primaries (`ink`,
  `paper`, `ember`, plus `bt-violet`) are exact. The neutral and amber scales are a derivation
  and must be corrected from the Figma library later — marked in CSS as unconfirmed. The brand
  guidelines PDF is in the project folder if exact values are needed.
- **~~Type contract review~~** — RESOLVED (D5): the entity types are locked in
  `src/lib/api/types.ts` and ready to hand to the backend team.

## 9. How to keep this doc useful

When you finish a unit of work, before you stop, update the sections that changed:
**phase tracker** (status), **decisions log** (new choices, dated), **open questions**
(resolved → strike/remove; new → add), and **live links** if a URL appears. A stale log is
worse than none — it should always describe the repo _as it is right now_.
